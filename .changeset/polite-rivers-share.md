"@devsym/graph-toolkit-react": patch
---

Add agent-focused usage documentation (`AGENTS.md`) and link it from the main README. Include `AGENTS.md` in published package files so downstream coding agents can consume scenario-based guidance.

Add a new migration guide at `docs/MGT_MIGRATION.md` with a general MGT-to-Graph-Toolkit-React path and a dedicated Teams migration section, and link it from the README.
